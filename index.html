                <li>Quick Read</li>
                    <p>I'm Reagan Roberts, I'm 23 years old I have two brothers named Slade and Pryce. I've played basketball since I was 5 years old up until I has a bad accident in 2016. I would say basketball and sports shaped my life up until my accident but now I would say that's what actually has shaped my life since. I broke both my legs, both wrist, some other stuff and had a stroke. Since then I believe I've become a better person and understand life much better than most people my age. I've had somewhere around 20 surgeries since then and its been a lot of work mentally, emotionally and definitely physically but I think hope and pray down the road I can look back and say it was 100% worth it (I'm at like a 59.4% right now).</p>
                <li>Education</li>
                    <p>I completed pre high school education in Washington. Then my family moved so I went to high school in Virginia and then went to college at Central Connecticut State University.</p>
                <li>Past Jobs</li>
                    <p>My past jobs are all retail and restaurant business but I would also put basketball on this list because it's a full time job and I essentially got paid to play by earning a scholarship to college.</p>
                <li>Goals</li>
                    <p>My goals in life consist of, marrying my current girlfriend/ best friend, starting a business, becoming a public speaker, adopting children, and coming out of Code Fellows confident enough in my ability to code to apply for jobs.</p>
